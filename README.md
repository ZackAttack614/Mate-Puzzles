# Mate Puzzle Finder

This is a placeholder README for now. To get started quickly, download a PGN file from lichess (or wherever) and call it `lichess_games.pgn`. Make sure you put Stockfish somewhere accessable (by default, it'll look in `./stockfish/`.

Then, just run `find_mate_puzzles.py` to have Stockfish start finding puzzle candidates.
